Trevor Barrett recently recieved his PhD in Psychology under the advisement of Mary Hegarty at University of California, Santa Barbara. Working in the Spatial Thinking Lab, Trevor's early research focused on issues surrounding interaction design in the context of STEM problem solving tasks using a tangible user interface in a mixed reality environment. For his dissertation research, he employed model-based clustering to predict users' cognitive strategy based on response time and individual differences in ability.

Working in the Spatial Thinking Lab, Trevor gained extensive laboratory experience working on and supervising multiple collaborative experimental research projects. He feels just as at home advising Advanced Research Methods Laboratory group projects as he does contributing presentations at cross-disciplinary multi-institution NSF grant meetings. Trevor enjoys developing tools and analytics pipelines for students and colleagues to better express their data stories and confidently make actionable inferences. He is currently looking for a position to apply his training in Experimental Psychology along with scalable machine learning methods at a company or research group solving tomorrow's problems.
