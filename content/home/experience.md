* Visual Stimuli Generation: Developed and documented a programmatic stimuli generation process with [imagemagick] (https://imagemagick.org/index.php) on a Linux virtual machine and Adobe Photoshop.
    
* Data Collection: Developed and maintained automated data collection workflows using batch tasks to sync files between the data collection workstations and data analysis workstations.
    
* Data Processing: Scripted in Python to munge messy Excel files into tidy CSV files.
   
* Data Analyis: Developed R scripts to run both locally and by our collaborators at University of Utah's Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute. The resulting end-to-end data visualization and analysis pipeline continued to be used after I moved on from the project.

* Co-authored paper: "Where are you? The effect of uncertainty and its visual representation on location judgments in GPS-like displays." Awarded 2016 Raymond Nickerson Best Paper Award in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied.
  
* Presented research at all-hands meetings in Salt Lake City and Santa Barbara, as well as CogSci 2016, Bremen, Germany.
