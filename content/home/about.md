Trevor Barrett recently recieved his PhD in Psychology under the advisement of Mary Hegarty at University of California, Santa Barbara. Master's research focused on issues surrounding interaction design of virtual environments for STEM problem solving tasks. For this project, a custom tangible user interface and an angled mirror apparatus were used to create the illusion of physically manipulating the virtual model in mixed reality.

Trevor feels just as at home advising Advanced Research Methods Laboratory group projects as he does contributing presentations at cross-disciplinary multi-institution NSF grant meetings. He enjoys developing tools and analytics pipelines for students and colleagues to better express their data stories. and confidently make actionable inferences. He is currently looking for a position to apply his training in Experimental Psychology along with scalable machine learning methods at a company or research group solving tomorrow's problems.
